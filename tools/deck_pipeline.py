SolEnshaded Complete Deck Asset & Pipeline Tool
==============================================
Provides a full end-to-end automated workflow:
1. 'export-base': Slices the CC0 master SVG and binary cache into 54 standalone
   individual card SVGs and PNGs with clear names and a manifest.
2. 'generate-prompts': Generates specialized Gemini image-to-image prompts for all
   54 cards for any custom theme (e.g. Victorian Steampunk, Eldritch, Cyberpunk).
3. 'generate-ai': Calls Google GenAI (gemini-2.5-flash-image / gemini-3-pro-image)
   via API to generate card illustrations, then vectorizes them with vtracer.
4. 'assemble': Takes standalone card vector SVGs and assembles them with
   mathematical precision into the master 9x6 grid SVG.
5. 'auto-deck': End-to-end automation: generates AI cards -> vectorizes -> assembles
   ready-to-play deck in decks/<theme>_svg.svg.
